# Garfield_Lasagna_Cat_The_Pipe_Strip_07-27-1968_Auto_Typer
This uses a python script to automatically type **THE ENTIRE SCRIPT FOR LASAGNA CAT'S MASTERPIECE: 07/27/1968 **.

Seriously, the whole thing.

It simulates typing so that services that read 'now typing...' will make others think you're unhinged, and are typing the entire fucking thing.

Initiate with `python3 auto_typing_garfield.py`
